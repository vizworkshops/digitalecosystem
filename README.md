# Welcome to the Digital Ecosystem workshop repository. 

This repo contains materials and a wiki that will help walk you through how to set up a simple digital ecosystem using software and data that is freely and (mostly) readily available. Please go to the wiki - https://github.com/vizworkshops/digitalecosystem/wiki for tutorial.

One of the motivations for this workshop is to provide a model for how to easily create a digital map that incorporates point data, polygon boundary files, and historical maps.
