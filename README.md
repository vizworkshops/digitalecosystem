# Welcome to the Digital Ecosystem workshop repository. 

This repo contains materials and a wiki that will help walk you through how to set up a simple digital ecosystem using software and data that is freely and (mostly) readily available. 

One of the underlying motivations for this workshop is to provide a model for how to easily create a digital map that incorporates point data with raster data (historical maps).
